# Python Assignment 1

**Submission date:** 17 October 24

1. WAP to check whether a number is even or odd.
2. WAP to check whether a person is eligible for voting.
3. WAP to enter a number between 1 to 7 as days of a week and print the day accordingly. (Monday, Tuesday ...) using if-elif case.
4. WAP to enter a number between 1 to 7 as days of a week and print the day accordingly. (Monday, Tuesday ...) using match case.
5. WAP to check whether a year is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if “any one of” the following conditions are satisfied:
   - The year is a multiple of 400.
   - The year is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100.
6. WAP to calculate the marks of 5 subjects, compute average and display the grade as per the following rules:
   - average >= 90 : “A"
   - average >= 80 : “B"
   - average >= 70 : “C"
   - average >= 60 : “D"
7. WAP to input a character. Check whether the character is a vowel or consonant.
8. WAP to search an element in a list [use for: else clause].
9. Write a program to take a single digit number from the keyboard and print its spelling in English word using if-elif.
10. WAP to input three numbers and arrange them in ascending order.
11. Write a program to take a single digit number from the keyboard and print its spelling in English word using match case.
12. WAP to read two numbers and an arithmetic operator [+,-,*,/,%] perform the operation and display the computed result. [Hint: use elif statement].
13. WAP to check whether an inputted character is uppercase or lowercase or digit or any other character.
14. Develop a number guessing game using loops and conditional statements. Ask the user to guess a secret number. If the user has not guessed the correct number, provide him/her a hint.
15. WAP to prompt the user to enter name and password until it enters "stud" in name and "pass" in password. Allow only five attempts.
16. WAP to display numbers from 15 to 1 in descending order.
17. WAP to display the sum of numbers from 11 to 200 using a for loop.
18. WAP to display the average of numbers from 5 to 15 and 21 to 60.
19. WAP to display odd numbers from 5 to 30.
20. WAP to find the factorial of a number inputted by the user.
21. WAP to find the sum of digits of an integer number.
22. WAP to display the sum of even numbers between 30 and 50.
23. WAP to print the multiplication table.
24. WAP to print the following patterns:
    ```
    1
    22
    333
    4444
    ```
25. WAP to print pattern:
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    ***
    **
    *
    ```
    [Ask the user to enter the number of rows in the first half]
26. WAP to print pattern:
    ```
    A
    BB
    CCC
    DDDD
    ```
27. Write a program to find whether a given number is an Armstrong Number.
    **Hint:**
    Given a number x, determine whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not. A positive integer of n digits is called an Armstrong number of order n (order is the number of digits) if:
    ```
    abcd = pow(a,n) + pow(b,n) + pow(c,n) + pow(d,n)
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```
    153 is an Armstrong number.
    1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3 = 153
    ```

28. WAP to generate the Fibonacci series up to n terms.
    **Hint:**
    Fibonacci series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
    Formula: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 with seed values: F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
    ```
    f1=0, f2=1,
    f3=f1+f2,
    f4=f3+f2
    f5=f4+f3 ....
    ```

29. Write a program that checks whether a number is a prime number or not.
30. WAP to calculate the sum and average of a given array: arr=(‘i’,[1,2,3,4,5]).
31. Write a Python program to reverse the order of the items in the array.
32. Write a Python program to remove duplicate elements in a given array of integers.

33. Write a program that takes a string as input and prints it in reverse order.
34. Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
35. Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
36. Write a program that removes duplicate characters from a string.
37. WAP to print even length words in a string. [Hint: use split() and for loop].
38. WAP to remove spaces from a given string: “Python is very easy”. [Hint: use split() and then join()].
39. WAP to convert a given list of ASCII values to a string. [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]. [Hint: use chr() to convert ASCII value to character].
40. WAP to print the individual characters of the string inputted by the user in the following way:
    **Example:** H—e—l—l—o
